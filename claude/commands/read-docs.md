I'll search for and read documentation files related to your keywords: $ARGUMENTS

Let me find all relevant documentation:

1. First, I'll search the docs/ folder for files matching your keywords
2. Then I'll read each matching file to provide you with the relevant information
3. If multiple files match, I'll read all of them to give you comprehensive context

Searching for documentation now...
