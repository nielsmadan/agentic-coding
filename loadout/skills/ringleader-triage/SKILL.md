description: Recurring cleanup of dormant agent sessions from the last few days — decide per session whether to archive, keep going, snooze, keep long-term or delete, harvest what's finished, name and review what's open. Use when the user says "triage sessions", "triage my sessions", "clean up my sessions", or invokes triage.

# Triage

Scope: **recent** — the inbox is bounded to the last few days of activity
(`--recent`), so a run stays small and finishable. For the full, unbounded backlog use
the `cleanup` skill instead; it runs this same flow without the bound. `triage` and
`cleanup` differ only in scope (recent window vs. whole backlog).

This skill uses two mechanisms your agent provides. `[SELECT]`: use your native
structured-choice tool (Claude Code: `AskUserQuestion`) to get a per-item decision (one
question per session, offering the five outcomes in step 4); if you have none, present a
**numbered list** and read back the choices. `[FAN-OUT]`: run the harvest sub-protocol's
extract phase for the finished sessions **in parallel** if your agent supports subagents,
otherwise **sequentially, one at a time**. Everything else — calling `rl`, strategic
ordering, the progress tally, the harvest sub-protocol — is in `references/playbook.md`;
this file only adds the flow.

## Flow

1. **Say what this run will do, then snapshot the baseline.** Per
   `references/playbook.md` § Opening, baseline, closeout — name the scope (how many
   sessions in the recent window, across how many projects), say that the run starts by
   deleting tiny/stale junk and then asks for a decision per session, and record the
   baseline numbers before anything changes.

2. **Auto-prune junk.** Run `rl prune` (preview). Show the user what would go, and on
   their OK run `rl prune --delete` — feed the confirmation non-interactively per
   `references/playbook.md`.

3. **Build the inbox.** Run `rl triage --recent <N> --json` (default `N=7` — the last
   week — unless the user asks for a different window) and group the results by their
   `project` field.

4. **Per project, with the progress tally.** Working project by project, oldest activity
   first (see `references/playbook.md` § Strategic ordering), `[SELECT]` one of five
   outcomes for each session.

   **Present them in this order, every time** — a stable list is what lets someone answer
   quickly without re-reading, and it keeps the irreversible option away from the default
   position. Mark your suggestion with "(recommended)" on the option itself rather than by
   reordering:

   1. **Done — harvest and archive it.** Pull anything worth keeping into the docs, then
      move the transcript out of the resume picker.
   2. **Still going — leave it open.** Stays in the picker; comes back to this inbox when
      the session next changes.
   3. **Not now — remind me in N days.** Drops out until then, and returns on its own.
   4. **Keep long-term.** Stays live and resumable, but never comes back to this inbox.
   5. **Delete it permanently.** Removes the transcript for good. **Nothing is harvested
      first** — pick "Done" instead if any of it is worth keeping.

   List the sessions before asking, one per numbered entry, in the shape given in
   `references/playbook.md` § Presenting a batch — never several sessions per sentence,
   and at most 8 per batch. Never present a bare status word ("finished", "open") as the
   choice itself — see `references/playbook.md` § `[SELECT]`.

5. **Apply the choices.**
   - *done* → add to this run's harvest queue (don't archive yet — step 6 does both).
   - *still going* → classify it: `rl session set --session <id> --status <status> --what
     "<what>" --name "<name>"`.
   - *remind me* → `rl session snooze <id> --for <days>` (ask how many days).
   - *keep long-term* → `rl session keep <id>`. It stays live and resumable but never
     returns to the inbox — see `references/playbook.md` § Leaving the triage inbox.
   - *delete* → `rl session delete <id>` now. Irreversible, and harvests nothing.

6. **Harvest the finished set.** Follow the harvest sub-protocol in `references/playbook.md`.
   When a model is configured, that means `rl session complete <id>` per finished session
   (harvest + archive in one step); otherwise `[FAN-OUT]`-extract each queued session and do
   the single synthesis write per repo.

7. **Name + review the open set.** Run `rl session name` to (re)name the sessions just
   classified, then `rl session mark reviewed <id>` for each.

8. **Record and close out.** Run `rl session mark cleaned <project>` for each project
   completed this run, then run the closeout from `references/playbook.md` § Opening,
   baseline, closeout: the before → after table against step 1, what changed, what came
   back **blocked on the user**, and what's left. End by `[SELECT]`-ing the next step —
   next project batch, `cleanup` for the whole backlog, resume a named blocked session, or
   stop — and act on their choice.
