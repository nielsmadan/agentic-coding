description: TypeScript-specific code review focused on JUDGMENT-level type design a linter can't decide — type modeling (make invalid states unrepresentable), inference-vs-annotation calls, and casts/`any` that hide a real modeling problem. Deliberately does NOT duplicate the project's linter, and checks first whether that linter is type-aware at all (typescript-eslint's `*-type-checked` configs, or oxlint's opt-in `--type-aware`) — because more than half the rules it defers to need type information. Auto-invoked by `code-review` on TypeScript projects. Triggers "review typescript", "typescript review", "type design review".

# Review TypeScript

TypeScript review that covers what a **type-aware linter cannot decide for you** — how types are *modeled*, when to *annotate vs infer*, and whether a cast or `any` is papering over a design problem. These are judgment calls; the mechanical rules are ESLint's job.

## Relationship to the lint layer (read first)

**This skill assumes a *type-aware* linter handles the mechanical layer, and "type-aware" is the
load-bearing word.** Most of the rules below need type information, so they run only where that
layer is actually switched on. Establish which linter the project uses and whether it has types
before deciding anything is out of scope.

| Linter | Type-aware layer | How to tell |
|---|---|---|
| **typescript-eslint** | The `*-type-checked` configs | `eslint.config.*` / `.eslintrc*` extends `recommended-type-checked` or `strict-type-checked`, with `parserOptions.projectService` (or `project`) |
| **oxlint** | **Opt-in.** Stable since July 2026 (tsgolint v7), covering 59 of typescript-eslint's 61 type-aware rules | `--type-aware` on the command line, or `options.typeAware: true` in the root config. Also needs the `oxlint-tsgolint` package and TypeScript 7+ |
| Neither, or syntax-only | none | Everything in the list below is **yours** to review |

**Three oxlint traps, each of which makes a linter look configured when it isn't:**

- **Only the `correctness` category is on by default.** `pedantic`, `style`, `suspicious`,
  `restriction`, `perf` and `nursery` are all off unless something turns them on.
- **`-A` / `-W` / `-D` apply to whole categories and are applied left to right.** A script like
  `oxlint -A all -D typescript/no-explicit-any src/` allows every category and then denies one
  rule — so it runs **exactly one rule**, and a clean run means almost nothing.
- **`oxlint-tsgolint` is an *optional* peer dependency**, so when it is missing nothing complains;
  type-aware rules simply never run.

**Only treat the following as out of scope when the type-aware layer genuinely runs.** Rules marked
† need type information and are absent from any syntax-only setup — in that case they are review
findings, not lint findings:

- Redundant/unnecessary assertions (`no-unnecessary-type-assertion`†), explicit `any`
  (`no-explicit-any`), unsafe `any` flow (`no-unsafe-*`†), non-null `!` (`no-non-null-assertion`)
- `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` without a reason (`ban-ts-comment`)
- Floating/misused promises, `await`-thenable, throw/reject non-Error (`no-floating-promises`†,
  `no-misused-promises`†, `only-throw-error`†)
- Dangerous built-ins `Function`/`{}`/wrapper objects (`no-unsafe-function-type`,
  `no-empty-object-type`, `no-wrapper-object-types`)
- Truthiness/nullish traps, `??` vs `||`, template-expression coercion
  (`strict-boolean-expressions`†, `prefer-nullish-coalescing`†, `restrict-template-expressions`†)
- `import type`, `prefer-as-const`, trivially-inferrable annotations (`consistent-type-imports`,
  `prefer-as-const`, `no-inferrable-types`)
- Always-true/false conditions, single-use generics, exhaustive switches
  (`no-unnecessary-condition`†, `no-unnecessary-type-parameters`†, `switch-exhaustiveness-check`†)

That † set is over half the list, which is why the baseline read matters: on a syntax-only project
this skill's scope is materially wider, and staying silent about a floating promise because "lint
covers it" would be wrong.

## What this skill checks

**Type design is decided once; the ways it gets violated recur with every change.** So the default
review looks only at what the diff introduces. Whether the project's linter is configured well at
all is a **project-level** question — see §P, which runs at `--all` and nowhere else.

Run on `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.mts` / `.cts`. Complements `review-cleancode` (SOLID/DRY/smells) — don't repeat it.

## Usage

```
/review-typescript                  # Review context-related code
/review-typescript --staged         # Review staged changes
/review-typescript --unpushed       # Review files changed across all unpushed commits
/review-typescript --changed        # Review unstaged changes
/review-typescript --all            # Full codebase audit (parallel agents)
/review-typescript --multi          # Also get external advisor opinions
```

## Scope

| Flag | Scope | Method |
|------|-------|--------|
| (none) | Context-related code | Files from the current conversation context. If no context, ask the user to specify files or use `--staged`/`--changed`/`--all`. |
| `--staged` | Staged changes | `git diff --cached --name-only` |
| `--unpushed` | Files changed across unpushed commits | `git diff --name-only $(git rev-list HEAD --not --remotes \| tail -1)^..HEAD` |
| `--changed` | Unstaged changes | `git diff --name-only` |
| `--all` | Full codebase + **§P project-level checks** | Glob `*.ts`/`*.tsx`/`*.mts`/`*.cts`, parallel agents |
| `--multi` | Add external opinions | Combines with any scope above; invokes `second-opinion --quick` |

`--unpushed` derives its range from `git rev-list HEAD --not --remotes` (oldest unpushed commit's parent → HEAD). If nothing is unpushed, or there is no remote/upstream (or the range walks back to the root commit) so it can't be determined reliably, stop and ask the user to pick another scope. Restrict the resolved file list to TypeScript extensions before reviewing.

## Workflow

1. **Determine scope** (see table) and filter to TypeScript files only.
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** in the repo root for project conventions.
3. **Establish the lint baseline.** Identify the linter (`eslint.config.*`/`.eslintrc*`, `.oxlintrc.json`, or a `lint` script in `package.json` — read the script, since CLI flags can override the config entirely) and whether type-aware linting runs. Record which of the † rules above are therefore **in** scope. At a narrower scope this only tells you what to stay quiet about; the recommendation itself is §P.
4. **Review each file** against the three judgment categories — against what the diff introduces (load `references/checklist.md`). Add **§P only at `--all`**.
5. **Parallelize** if scope has >5 files: one sub-agent per category, merge and dedupe.
6. **External opinions** (if `--multi`): invoke `second-opinion --quick` with this prompt:

   ```
   Read-only TypeScript review. Assume a type-aware linter (typescript-eslint `strict-type-checked`, or oxlint with `--type-aware`) already handles mechanical rules — do NOT repeat lint-level findings. Focus on TYPE DESIGN judgment: are invalid states representable that shouldn't be? Are types modeled with unions of interfaces or a bag of optional fields? Are functions returning wider types than callers need? Is inference used where it could be, and are annotations added only where they serve a purpose (definition-site checking of complex literals, public-API contracts)? Do any casts/`any` compile but hide a wrong upstream type? 300 words or less.
   ```

   Wait for all external results before proceeding.
7. **Classify severity** and **report**, grouped by severity.

## Checklist (judgment only)

**Load `references/checklist.md`** before reviewing files — it carries the full bullet
catalogue for all three categories plus the severity definitions. The categories:

1. **Type modeling & design** — the core value. Invalid states representable, bag-of-optionals
   where a union belongs, outputs wider than callers need, nullability in the interior instead
   of at the perimeter, in-band sentinels, hand-copied shapes that will drift.
2. **Inference vs. annotation** — default to inference; annotate where it *serves a purpose*
   (definition-site checking of complex literals, public-API contracts). `satisfies` vs colon
   annotation vs `as`.
3. **Casts & escape hatches** — the residue after lint: a cast that compiles but hides a wrong
   upstream type, a cast standing in for validation at a trust boundary, `any` masking a
   modeling gap.

State your reasoning for each finding. "Cast hides that `getUser` is mistyped as `any`" is a
finding; "there's a cast here" is not (and is probably already lint-flagged).

## P. Project-level checks — `--all` only

Configuration, not code. It changes rarely, so raising it on a diff review is noise.

- **Is there a type-aware layer at all?** If not, that single change fixes the whole † class above
  far better than a reviewer eyeballing diffs. Recommend the project's *own* linter's route, not a
  migration:
  - **typescript-eslint** → extend `strict-type-checked` (or `recommended-type-checked`) and set
    `parserOptions.projectService`.
  - **oxlint** → add the `oxlint-tsgolint` package and turn on `options.typeAware: true` (or
    `--type-aware`), on TypeScript 7+. Do **not** tell an oxlint project to adopt typescript-eslint;
    it has covered 59 of the 61 type-aware rules since July 2026. There is no `strict-type-checked`
    equivalent preset, so categories are selected explicitly.
- **Are whole categories switched off by a CLI flag** that overrides the config file — an `-A all`
  in a `package.json` lint script, say?
- **tsconfig**: `strict`, and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.

## Output Format

```markdown
## TypeScript Review: {scope}

### Baseline
{One line: which linter, and whether type-aware linting runs — so the reader knows which of the †
rules this review was responsible for. **At `--all` only:** the §P recommendations. Omit on a diff
review if the type-aware layer is in place.}

### Critical (illegal state can reach runtime)
- {file}:{line} — {category}: {description}
  **Why it's not a lint finding:** {what judgment this needed}
  **Impact:** {what breaks}
  **Fix:** {model change / boundary validation — with code}

### High (modeling problems that will cause bugs)
- {file}:{line} — {category}: {description}
  **Fix:** {solution}

### Medium (annotation/inference & type-design)
- {file}:{line} — {category}: {description} — {suggested change}

### Suggestions
- {opportunities}
```

If `--multi` was used, append one subsection per advisor that responded (titled with the advisor's name as reported by `second-opinion`), then a **Cross-Model Agreement** subsection.

## Examples

**Invalid state representable:**
> /review-typescript --staged

Finds a `FetchState` type `{ loading: boolean; data?: T; error?: string }` — nothing prevents `loading: true` with both `data` and `error` set. Reports High with a discriminated-union rewrite. Not a lint finding: the type is internally consistent; only a human knows the states are illegal.

**Cast hiding a mistyped source:**
> /review-typescript --changed

Finds `const total = order.items as LineItem[]` where `order.items` is typed `any` (from an untyped API client). Reports High — fix the client's return type; the cast is a symptom. `no-unnecessary-type-assertion` stays silent because the cast is load-bearing.

**Good annotation missing:**
> /review-typescript

A 40-line hand-written `const config = {...}` has no type, so a typo in a nested key only errors at a distant consumer. Reports Medium — add `satisfies AppConfig` for definition-site checking while keeping the narrow inferred shape.

## Troubleshooting

### Findings overlap with ESLint
**Solution:** Check whether the project actually *runs* that rule — over half the list needs type information, and under oxlint that layer is opt-in and silently absent without `oxlint-tsgolint`. If the rule runs, drop the finding. If it doesn't, the finding is legitimately yours; fold the configuration gap into §P rather than reporting it per-occurrence. This skill only reports what a type-aware linter can't judge.

### Can't tell if a boundary cast is safe
**Solution:** Trace where the value comes from. In-process, already-typed data → the cast may be fine (or redundant, i.e. lint's problem). External/parsed/DOM data → recommend a runtime guard; the type system can't vouch for data it never saw.

## Notes

- Model first, annotate second, cast last. Most cast findings dissolve once the underlying type is modeled correctly.
- Respect project conventions in CLAUDE.md (a codebase may deliberately allow `null`, prefer `interface`/`type`, etc.).
- Don't be dogmatic: brands, utility-type derivation, and satisfies all have ergonomic costs — recommend them where they prevent real bugs, not everywhere they're possible.
